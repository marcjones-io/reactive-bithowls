# reactive-bithowls
An interactive audio-visual environment written for performance with Virginia's Mobile Interactive Computer Ensemble

### about:
Reactive bitHowls is a collaboration between [Marc Jones](https://soundcloud.com/marcjones-67394036), [Rebecca Beauchamp (SWAN MEAT)](https://soundcloud.com/rebabeauchamp), and [Will Mulaney (ING)](https://www.facebook.com/ingthebandfromvirginia/?pnref=story.unseen-section) made using the visual programming langauge Max. This piece takes in audio via the system microphone, analyzes its frequency range and produces reactive audio and visuals. The visuals are generated using Jitter for Max, while the sound generation is handled within Max using FM synthesis to create tones which are then locked into a harmonic scale.

### instructions:
Open the "Mice_WillRebeccaMarc" Max project then open the main max patcher. Activate the ADC and DAC (microphone and speaker objects) on the patch, then initiate the program by pressing the "space-bar". The patch will consume your full display, if you want to return to the patching screen, press the "space-bar" again.
